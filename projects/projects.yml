  description: >
    The HotellingEllipse package facilitates the comparison 
    of multivariate datasets based on their PCA or PLS scores by computing the 
    Hotelling's T-squared statistic. The package also provides the semi-minor and 
    semi-major axes for drawing Hotelling's T-squared ellipses at the commonly used 
    95% and 99% confidence levels. Additionally, it allows users to obtain the x-y 
    coordinates at user-defined confidence levels, enabling the construction of 
    ellipses with customized confidence levels.

  description: >
    The ConfidenceEllipse package calculates the coordinates of elliptical joint 
    regions at a specified confidence level. It provides the flexibility to estimate 
    classical or robust confidence regions, which can be visualized as 2D or 3D plots.
    Additionally, the functions allow users to group the dataset based 
    on categorical variables and estimate separate confidence regions for each group.

  description: >
    The specProc package performs a wide range of preprocessing tasks essential 
    for spectroscopic data analysis. Spectral preprocessing is essential in ensuring 
    accurate and reliable results by minimizing the impact of various distortions 
    and artifacts that can arise during data acquisition or due to inherent 
    characteristics of the sample or instrument.
