Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate or learn more about my work.

## **Current Research**

**Soil Analysis Using LIBS**\
Leading cutting-edge research to enhance quantitative analysis of agricultural soils, with a focus on mitigating matrix interference through LIBS combined with advanced chemometric modeling. This work aims to support sustainable agricultural practices.

## **Past Research**

**Development of a High-Throughput LIBS System**\
Developed a fiber-optic LIBS system integrated with chemometrics for online and real-time monitoring of electrolyte solutes in clinical and point-of-care (POC) settings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Predicting Soil Texture**\
Developed a LIBS-based benchtop instrument for the quantitative analysis of agricultural soils, leveraging machine learning and chemometrics to interpret complex spectral data. This research was highlighted in the *Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry* on the back cover of Volume 34, Issue 8 (2019), for its contributions to soil texture prediction.

**Groundwater Monitoring for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)**\
Developed a compact, robust LIBS sensor for in-situ monitoring of CCS activities in extreme environments (high temperature, pressure, and salinity). Featured on the front cover of the *Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry*, Volume 31, Issue 7 (2016), for underwater LIBS applications in carbonate mineral dissolution studies under rising CO~2~ pressure.

**Wavelength-Selective Excitation Approaches in LIBS**\
During my PhD research in partnership with the NRC, I focused on improving the limit of detection (LOD) for trace impurities in metallic alloys using advanced selective wavelength techniques in LIBS.

Key Contributions:

-   Explored LIBS-LIF, RELIBS, and RLIBS for enhanced LODs in impurity analysis.
-   Proposed efficient excitation-fluorescence schemes for targeted element detection.
-   Our RELIBS research was featured on the inside front cover of the *Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry*, Volume 25, Issue 5 (2010).
