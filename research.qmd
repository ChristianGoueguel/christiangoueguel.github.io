## Current Research

### Development of Laser-based Gas Detection System

Designing a highly compact, long-path tunable mid-infrared diode laser system for the detection and quantification of trace gases, with applications in environmental monitoring.

## Past Research

### Soil Analysis Using LIBS

Led research to enhance quantitative analysis of agricultural soils, with a focus on mitigating matrix interference through LIBS combined with advanced chemometric modeling. This work aims to support sustainable agricultural practices.

### Development of a High-Throughput LIBS System

Developed a fiber-optic LIBS system integrated with chemometrics for online and real-time monitoring of electrolyte solutes in clinical and point-of-care (POC) settings.

### Predicting Soil Texture

Developed a LIBS-based benchtop instrument for the quantitative analysis of agricultural soils, leveraging machine learning and chemometrics to interpret complex spectral data. This research was highlighted in the *Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry* on the back cover of Volume 34, Issue 8 (2019), for its contributions to soil texture prediction.

### Groundwater Monitoring for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)

Developed a compact, robust LIBS sensor for in-situ monitoring of CCS activities in extreme environments (high temperature, pressure, and salinity). One of our research projects earned the prestigious distinction of being featured on the front cover of the *Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry* (Volume 31, Issue 7, 2016). This study explored the application of underwater LIBS for real-time, in situ monitoring of carbonate mineral dissolution under rising CO~2~ pressure.

### Wavelength-Selective Excitation Approaches in Laser-produced plasma

Research focused on improving the limit of detection (LOD) for trace impurities in metallic alloys using selective wavelength approaches in laser-produced plasma. Explored LA-LIF, resonance-enhance LIBS, and RLA-LIF approaches for enhanced LODs in impurity analysis. Proposed efficient excitation-fluorescence schemes for targeted element detection in RLA-LIF. Our research on the investigation of resonance-enhance LIBS was featured on the inside front cover of the *Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry*, Volume 25, Issue 5 (2010).
